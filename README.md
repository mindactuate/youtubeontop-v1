## This is YouTubeOnTop V1.0

A small youtube-player that will stick in a corner of your screen and stay always on top of all other windows. Focus on your work and not on searching for the youtube tab in your browser.

### One Euro is all I need :)

Lot's of work - even with assistance of great frameworks, libraries and tools. The app costs a small amount of 1â‚¬. But still free testing allowed - unlimited.
