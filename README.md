## This is YouTubeOnTop V1.0

A small youtube-player that will stick in a corner of your screen and stay always on top of all other windows. Focus on your work and not on searching for the youtube tab in your browser.

### Cross platform

You can use it with **Windows**, **Linux** or **MacOS**.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
