## This is YouTubeOnTop V1.0 - The first "public" version of the app. :)

A small youtube-player that will stick in a corner of your screen and stay always on top of all other windows. Focus on your work and not on searching for the youtube tab in your browser.

### One Euro is all I need :)

Lot's of work - even with assistance of great frameworks, libraries and tools. The app costs a small amount of 1â‚¬. But still free testing allowed - unlimited.

### FAQ

## I've got a Network Error info box at program start
Please stay calm, click "Ok" and just play the Dinosaurier game for a while. Just joking. There is just a network error. Please check your internet connection (use your normal browser and check). If there is internet it might be, that you're behind a proxy server (often in companies). To solve that please right click in YouTubeOnTop and click on *Proxy*. There is lots of guidance for how to find and how to set your proxy. It is easy - I promise. :)
